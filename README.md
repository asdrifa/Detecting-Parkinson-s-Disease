# Detecting-Parkinson-s-Disease
ML - Python

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than half million individuals every year in Bangladesh. In fact, My father is a patient of this disease. So, I thought of building a model to accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual.

In this Python machine learning project, using the Python libraries scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost, I have built a model using an XGBClassifier. I have loaded the data, got the features and labels, scaled the features, then splited the dataset, built an XGBClassifier, and then calculated the accuracy of the model.
